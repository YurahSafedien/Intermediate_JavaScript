 : An example:

   - Invisible buttons: The attacker can make a legitimate button or link invisible by setting its opacity to zero, and then place a fake button or link over it. When the user clicks on the visible element, they are actually clicking on the hidden element.

   - Transparent overlays: The attacker can place a transparent element over a legitimate button or link, making it invisible to the user. When the user clicks on what appears to be the legitimate button or link, they are actually clicking on the hidden element.
